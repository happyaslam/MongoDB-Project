# Law Firm Billing System Database Design

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the design of a MongoDB document database for a Law Firm Billing System. The system aims to efficiently track billable hours, expenses, and generate client invoices for a law firm.

## Project Requirements
The database should be able to:
- Track billable hours for each lawyer.
- Record expenses related to client cases.
- Generate client invoices based on billable hours and expenses.
- Store client information for invoicing purposes.
- Maintain user authentication and authorization.

## Data Model
### 1. Lawyers Collection
Stores information about lawyers working at the law firm.
- `_id`: unique identifier for the lawyer.
- `name`: name of the lawyer.
- `email`: email address of the lawyer.
- `password`: encrypted password for authentication.

### 2. Clients Collection
Contains details about the clients of the law firm.
- `_id`: unique identifier for the client.
- `name`: name of the client.
- `contact`: contact information of the client.
- `address`: address of the client.

### 3. Cases Collection
Stores information about the cases handled by the law firm.
- `_id`: unique identifier for the case.
- `case_name`: name or title of the case.
- `client_id`: reference to the client associated with the case.
- `lawyer_id`: reference to the lawyer handling the case.
- `status`: current status of the case (e.g., pending, ongoing, closed).

### 4. Billable Hours Collection
Records billable hours for each lawyer on specific cases.
- `_id`: unique identifier for the billable hour entry.
- `lawyer_id`: reference to the lawyer.
- `case_id`: reference to the case.
- `hours`: number of billable hours.
- `date`: date when the hours were logged.

### 5. Expenses Collection
Stores expenses incurred for client cases.
- `_id`: unique identifier for the expense entry.
- `case_id`: reference to the case.
- `description`: description of the expense.
- `amount`: amount spent.
- `date`: date when the expense was incurred.

## Conclusion
The proposed MongoDB document database design provides a structured approach to efficiently manage billable hours, expenses, and client invoices for a law firm. By organizing data into separate collections, the system can maintain data integrity and scalability while meeting the project requirements.
